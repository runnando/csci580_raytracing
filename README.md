Raytracing in Python from scratch with advanced features.

## Progress
- [ ] Core algorithm (4.11)
- [ ] Reflection (4.11)
- [ ] Refraction (4.11)
- [ ] Advanced feature 1 (4.18)
- [ ] Advanced feature 2 (4.24)

## Implementation Details

- `input_imgs`: directory to store all input images, including background, texture, scene...
- `outputs`: directory to store all output images and animations
- each module (backgrounds, textures...) should include a `__init__.py` specifying what needs to be imported when the package is called. 
- Feel free to change or rename files and implement each module as you like, but remember to update `__init__.py` for each module
- use `"[yr name]: major changes"` as your commit message
